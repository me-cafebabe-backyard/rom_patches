From 8a7c54e29e96f3b3782a171ad6a4ae25e6c1c476 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: David Ng <dave@codeaurora.org>
Date: Mon, 23 Sep 2013 18:50:24 -0700
Subject: [PATCH 1/2] init: Add vendor-specific initialization hooks.

Allow optional vendor-specific initializations
within init.  This can be used for runtime
initialization setup that init rc scripts do
not support.
